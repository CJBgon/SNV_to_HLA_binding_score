# We wrote a workflow to calculate neoantigen binding scores of 8, 9 and 10 peptide long neoantigens on patient HLA (Human leukocyte antigens) or murine MHC (Major histocompatibility complex). Starting from whole exsome sequencing results we determine non-synonymous mutations, acquire amino acid sequence of the affected proteins and calculate scores of each peptide fragment with netPanMHC4.0.
